VPath is a CUDA path tracer that fully solves the radiative transfer equation, which makes it capable of rendering complex lighting effects in an unbiased manner. 

<b>Features:</b>
  
	- Full Volumetric Scattering of light in homogeneous media
	- Accurate Monte Carlo Sub-surface Scattering
	- Diffuse BRDF
	- Fresnel Reflection/Refraction
	- Sphere primitives

<b>WARNING:</b> This project is meant as an experimental playground to test my ideas on volumetric rendering, so bare in mind that the code may contain bugs or present malfunction.
